            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Imperial Chocolate Made by a GERMAN Lately come into ENGLAND.</head>
            <p n="1">I <hi>IMperial Chocolate</hi> excels all others; because it is made of Sugar. the spiritual part, and not the gross body of Spice; and <hi>Cacao Nut</hi> first well cleansed from the Husk and Shells, then cured, and the earthy Substance taken from it, so that it doth not nauseate the Stomach, nor cause loathing or any Inclination to vomit but is a great Cordial, restores lost Strength, gives Appetite, wonderfully chearing the Spirits.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This highly purified Chocolate hath a sufficient quantity of the spiritual part of Spices only, to correct the coldness of the Nut, which neither obstructs nor inflames the Blood.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The choicestripe <hi>Cacoa</hi> Nut makes the brownest Chocolate, and the fattest; this Chocolate being cut or pared, shews within full of very small-milk-white specks every where of a like consistence.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Lay a little piece on your Tongue, it will presently dissolve, not leaving grit, sliminess, or any trash behind it, as other Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late doth that is made of uncured <hi>Cocoa</hi>-Nut, and adulterated with <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, Acorns, Almonds, Seeds, Husks and Shells of <hi>Cocoa</hi>-Nuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. To preserve it good a long time from its great Enemy moisture, keep it close in Tin-Boxes, or in old thick Oaken Chests in a dry place.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:203943:2"/> VI. Take half a pint of River water, when it boils, throw in an Ounce of Chocolate cut small, with as much beaten Loaf-Sugar, and immediately take it from the fire, (or in a moment it will burn and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate;) cover and mill it a little, then after half a quarter of an hour froth it very well with the mill, and drink it as hot as you can. Some love it with a new-lai'd Egg broken into it just before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to froth it up, which is not amiss; divers of those that put either Milk or Wine, have found the addition very prejudicial to their Healths.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. All good Chocolate once drest, must be drunk before ever it grow cold; if set before the fire to keep warm, it will not only burn, but lose its fine Spirits, and flavour and be quite spoil'd, remain flat and dead, very hurtful to the Stomach.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Chocolate scraped very fine with as much fine loaf-Sugar and cold Spring-water very well mill'd, is a curious Cordial Julip in hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but left it should over-cool the Stomach, it will be convenient to use the double spiced; for the <hi>Cacao</hi> Nut of it self is very cooling.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Pots to dress Chocolate for present drinking, with Mills exactly sized of a new form, as also convenient Boxes of several sizes, are to be had for the preserving Chocolate good a long time, at cheap rates.</p>
